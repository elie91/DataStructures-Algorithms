/**
 
*** Introduction
    Set of values that are related in a pair wize fashion
    Each item is called a Node (Vertex)
    There are connected by a Edge (Links)
    Ex : Roads, Family ...
     With the graphs , we can also have information on the edges , not only the nodes


*** Types of graphs
    1:
    - Directed      => can only go by one direction (sauf si le lien prÃ©cise les deux sens)
    - Undirected    => Move and back between nodes (unidirectionnal)
    Useful for describing traffic
    2:
    - Weigthed      =>  Also edges have values
    - Unweighted    =>  Only node have values
    3:
    - Cyclic        => Go to the nodes, and back to the first (circle)
    - Acyclic       => No way to go back    
   
*** Pros and Cons
    Indispensable for relationships
    Scaling is hard
